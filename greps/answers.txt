### a)
LineCount/Largest
grep -c "beed"
40

grep -c "izard"
40

grep -c "pika"
40

### b)
There are 15 Pokemon, I counted them by:
-- navigating into the folder,
-- listing out the file names as lines,
-- and calling for word count, but only the lines, not the words or characters.
-- technically it wasn't grep I used for that part, but I still used the command line.
